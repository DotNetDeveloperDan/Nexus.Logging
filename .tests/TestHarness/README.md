# ProgLeasing.System.Logging.TestHarness

This test harness contains integration tests using several services set up with ProgLeasing.System.Logging packages.
The different servers are run using a `TestServer`. The `Initializer` class configures the servers so they can talk to each other.

_This project is not considered a comprehensive example of possilbe logging implementations._

## Running tests
